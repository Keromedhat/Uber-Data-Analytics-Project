## üìä Driver Dashboard & Customer Dashboard Analysis  

### üéØ Overall Insights  

| Metric | Driver Dashboard | Customer Dashboard | Observation / Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Completion Rate** | **62%** | **62%** | Identical across both dashboards ‚Äî about 38% of trips remain incomplete, which is a major operational concern. |
| **Total Customers** | - | **148K** | A strong customer base that needs improved fulfillment performance. |
| **Driver Cancellation Rate** | **18%** | - | **High:** 18% of trips are canceled by drivers, the primary cause of low completion rate. |
| **Customer Cancellation Rate** | - | **6.6%** | **Relatively Low:** Much lower than driver cancellation, suggesting the issue is mainly driver-side. |
| **Avg Driver Rating** | **4.24** | **4.4** (by vehicle type) | **Acceptable:** but improvement needed to enhance overall service quality. |
| **Avg VTAT (Driver Arrival Time)** | **8.41 mins** | - | **High:** may cause customer cancellations and poor satisfaction. |
| **Avg CTAT (Customer Total Awaiting Time)** | - | **29.15 mins** | High total waiting time (including search time), potentially impacting the customer experience. |

### 2. Optimize Waiting Time (Improve Avg VTAT & CTAT)  

| Issue | Recommendation | Objective |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Avg VTAT (8.41 mins)** | Use **AI-based demand forecasting** to guide drivers to predicted demand hotspots before actual surge. | Reduce waiting time and cancellations. |
| **Customer Cancellations due to delay (12.1 mins)** | Set a **maximum wait threshold (e.g., 7 mins)** ‚Äî notify both parties when exceeded and offer alternative options. | Reduce cancellation caused by long waits. |
