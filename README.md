# 🚖 Uber Data Analytics Project
A data analytics project exploring Uber ride patterns through Python data cleaning and Power BI dashboards.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes Uber ride data to uncover insights about **driver performance**, **customer behavior**, and **operational trends**.  
It combines **data cleaning in Python** with **Power BI visualization** to produce clear, actionable insights that can enhance efficiency, satisfaction, and performance.

---

## 🧹 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)
Raw data included missing values, inconsistencies, and duplicates.  
Cleaning was done using **Pandas** and **NumPy** to ensure accuracy and usability.

**Steps:**
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant entries.  
- Handled missing values via imputation/removal.  
- Converted date/time columns to proper datetime format.  
- Normalized categorical columns (city, driver IDs, etc.).  
- Created calculated fields: ride duration, distance, fare range.
